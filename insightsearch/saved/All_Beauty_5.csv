0,"09 1, 2016",5.0,As advertised. Reasonably priced,B0000530HU
1,"11 14, 2013",5.0,Like the oder and the feel when I put it on my face.  I have tried other brands but the reviews from people I know they prefer the oder of this brand. Not hard on the face when dry.  Does not leave dry skin.,B0000530HU
2,"08 18, 2013",1.0,I bought this to smell nice after I shave.  When I put it on I smelled awful.  I am 19 and I smelled like a grandmother with too much perfume.,B0000530HU
3,"05 3, 2011",5.0,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.",B0000530HU
4,"05 6, 2011",5.0,"If you ever want to feel pampered by a shampoo this one is the one.  It smells like a wonderful perfume and cleans your hair until it shines plus adding a fullness that most other shampoo's don't give you.  It is expensive, but worth it!",B00006L9LC
5,"05 16, 2010",5.0,"If you know the scent of Diva, you'll LOVE this body cream....everyone says ""who smells so good in here!""",B00006L9LC

7,"05 7, 2018",2.0,No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its very hard to move around the hair and scalp. It does smell good and my hair feels clean.,B00006L9LC
8,"05 6, 2018",1.0,Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.,B00006L9LC
9,"05 6, 2018",1.0,"It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings",B00006L9LC
10,"05 6, 2018",5.0,Outstanding! Top organic shampoo!,B00006L9LC

13,"05 5, 2018",5.0,First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. Worth it for sure. No more struggle with getting rid of my dandruff problem. I use it about once per 2-3 days and it is more than enough to keep my hair and head skin healthy.,B00006L9LC
14,"05 3, 2018",1.0,Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin,B00006L9LC
15,"04 30, 2018",1.0,Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!,B00006L9LC
16,"04 28, 2018",1.0,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.",B00006L9LC
17,"04 28, 2018",5.0,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money,B00006L9LC
18,"04 25, 2018",5.0,works great,B00006L9LC
19,"04 23, 2018",5.0,Suffered from itchiness under my hair for couple of years. This product cured the itchiness completely. I took some 4-5 drops of it and then massaged my wet head for a minute approximately. After 2 uses noticed a considerable difference. It definitely gets the job done!,B00006L9LC

22,"04 19, 2018",4.0,Good but kind of drying,B00006L9LC
23,"04 19, 2018",5.0,"My psoriasis has been a lot less irritated now that I am swapping in this shampoo to replace my other shampoo every other wash. Not only is my hair cleaner, but my psoriasis is a lot less flared up. I am very happy with this shampoo.",B00006L9LC

26,"04 13, 2018",1.0,"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry.",B00006L9LC
27,"04 7, 2018",5.0,I have a dry scalp and occasional dandruff. This product really helps! Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works.,B00006L9LC
28,"04 7, 2018",5.0,"Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times.",B00006L9LC
29,"04 7, 2018",5.0,"Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders.",B00006L9LC
30,"04 6, 2018",1.0,"This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false ",B00006L9LC
31,"04 4, 2018",5.0,"It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use.",B00006L9LC
32,"04 4, 2018",2.0,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.,B00006L9LC
33,"04 2, 2018",1.0,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.,B00006L9LC

36,"03 27, 2018",1.0,"Throwing it away, burned my scalp.",B00006L9LC
37,"03 21, 2018",1.0,"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant.",B00006L9LC
38,"03 20, 2018",2.0,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.",B00006L9LC
39,"03 19, 2018",2.0,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust.",B00006L9LC
40,"03 15, 2018",5.0,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed.",B00006L9LC
41,"03 13, 2018",1.0,"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!",B00006L9LC
42,"03 6, 2018",1.0,"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately!

45,"03 1, 2018",3.0,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair,B00006L9LC
46,"02 28, 2018",4.0,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week..",B00006L9LC
47,"02 23, 2018",5.0,"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!",B00006L9LC

50,"02 11, 2018",1.0,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.",B00006L9LC
51,"01 31, 2018",5.0,I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon,B00006L9LC

62,"08 11, 2017",5.0,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon.",B00006L9LC
63,"08 2, 2017",5.0,I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill.

65,"07 11, 2017",5.0,My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!,B00006L9LC
66,"06 28, 2017",5.0,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!",B00006L9LC

132,"11 18, 2016",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,B00006L9LC

The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove.

I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster.

269,"01 4, 2016",5.0,"Finding a ""natural"" shampoo that isn't disappointing is a challenge. They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull.

270,"12 29, 2015",5.0,If you want your skin moisturized and feeling absolutely great then buy this body cream.  Perlier makes such a great line of products.

Who are you guys kidding? What a scam! There are plenty of other products out there that do a good job for far less money.
Use a nice conditioner (I still have several bottles left that I paid less than $2 for) and you'll still get nice results.  Bah-humbug for those scam artists trying to sell this for 10 times what it's worth.",B00006L9LC

277,"11 17, 2015",5.0,"I love this scent, and it's no longer being made.
I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.
If the fragrance gods are listening, please recreate this or something like it! I always get compliments on it.",B00006L9LC

I have been using it for about 1 week, and I have noticed my hair is soft and not wirey, from the bleach. I put it all over, minus my top roots and my hairline. This will only slightly weigh your hair down. My hair is past my hips, and I was not forced to cut it thanks to this product. I also, instead of rinsing straight away, let it sit overnight, washed it, and then repeated the process a few times. It's my new secret weapon against bleach breakage!!",B00006L9LC

406,"07 31, 2014",5.0,"I have been using this product since it launched, back several months ago. I have a ton of hair but it is somewhat fine. I color and use a ton of heat. So my hair is slightly on the dry side. This product line adds just the right amount of moisture and shine to my hair but doesn't make it oily and it isn't too heavy. I would recommend this product to anyone...no matter what your hair type! I buy all of my product from Sally Beauty Supply. This is one of my favorites!",B00006L9LC
407,"07 31, 2014",4.0,"Smells great. I'm looking for the cologne that matches. I have the Green Tea cologne and it's a great match for the Green Tea Body Wash. I wish this product offered the same. My complaint that the scent only lasts about 4 hours is the same as that for Green Tea. If you are looking for a very fresh scent (especially if you are a guy), this is a product I recommend.",B00006L9LC

409,"07 13, 2014",5.0,Making waves curl defining shampoo really is great for my perm.  It keeps my curls nice and curly.  I use it once a week usually and my perms last so much longer by using it.  I don't use any other product other than the shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks like it has a natural curl to it.  I highly recommend Making Waves shampoo.,B00006L9LC

411,"07 11, 2014",5.0,"Fantastic!  I love the Diva fragrance. It has been my fragrance of choice for over 30 years and I'm amazed at the number of compliments I receive.  People often ask what I'm wearing and where they can get it.  The original Creme Perfume in a tube (from the 1980's & 1990's) is no longer available and neither is the Body Lotion.  I do wish Ungaro would bring those items back.  Even though the formula for this Perfumed Body Cream in the jar does not seem to be the same as the original, it is still wonderful and I will continue using it, along with the spray perfume, as long as it is available.",B00006L9LC

413,"07 8, 2014",4.0,"Both of these products work well together.  The shampoo has an earthy smell,  but it is not unpleasant.  I feel that I am losing less hair.  Maybe it even feels thicker.  I know it is growing faster.",B00006L9LC

418,"06 22, 2014",5.0,"You Just need a little, and it lathers up great. Smells good, leaves my hair shiny and curly, and manageable. My only complaint is for some unknown reason, they stopped making the 32oz. size. Probably because they want you to buy more of the 11oz size.",B00006L9LC
419,"06 21, 2014",5.0,"These two products are very good for my hair.  I have colored, thinning mid length hair and it keeps my locks moisturized and looking good.  I scalp feel clean and I don't feel like these products weighs down my fine hair.  The fragrance is very great and doesn't bother me, even though I'm very sensitive to fragrances.  Will keep using these products.",B00006L9LC
420,"05 20, 2014",5.0,This cape was durable and very inexpensive.  I cut my husband's hair and this is just what I needed.  The velcro at the neck insures a proper fit.,B00006L9LC
421,"04 21, 2014",5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.",B00006L9LC

it yourself' you could tell where you was at on the curlers, because of the foam.  I have thin, fine,
naturally curly hair.  Because my hair is so thin and fine,  I wanted this perm mainly for body.  It worked really well for what I wanted.  Unfortunately I can't find it now.  Hope I can find it again.  I would recommend it to anyone.  (When I had my hair stylist used this perm, they was
amazed at how easy it was to use.)",B00006L9LC

I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you.",B00006L9LC

441,"11 21, 2013",5.0,"I have thick but fine hair, and I had a hugely horrible cut that left me with layers of split ends.  My hairdresser recommended this product and it's absolutely terrific for my hair.  It leaves it looking much better while it grows out.  My hair looks a little courser (nice), and I get great volume. Split ends are managed better.  Great smell too.  I use it with the Matrix conditioner (and I usually don't like conditioners) and it leaves my hair so soft but it doesn't lose its shape.  I was recently traveling and ran out, used a different product to wash my hair, and was miserable until I could get back to this product.",B00006L9LC

I use hydrating shampoo and the hair masque. Only a small dab needed.  The higher cost is made up for in value of the product. I occasionally change up shampoo by using the HBL volumizing shampoo.  With the hydrating I wash hair more quickly as it is rich but never leaves hair oily.  With the masque...I do use daily but I apply first at the brittle ends and then work up from there....basically only using the remaining residuals of the shampoo on my crown.  After washing I towel dry and after it begins to dry I then work into the dry ends, a pea sized amount of the HBL Shine and Seal.  Any residual on finger tips is lightly applied to areas with fly aways. My hair looks healthy and naturally shiny!  Products smell fresh and clean.",B00006L9LC

475,"02 13, 2013",5.0,"~BACKGROUND~
We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",B00006L9LC

This one has a similar impact. I use it as body wash too, but if you do it I recommend using a loofa to increase the longevity of the bottle. I've been using mine for four months and it only just now ran out. I have used it conservatively, maybe two times or three a week. I use the perfume too, but even with the perfume, my skin and hair still smells like the product for a few hours into the day.

484,"12 14, 2014",5.0,"NARS is a treasure for those who get to hold the velvety feeling case in their hand and the blush and eye shadow are my particular favorites here. Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter. That might sound scary but its so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what Im wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.

 This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and Im also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.

There are flecks in it but I wouldn't call it glitter at all. Just light reflecting partlcles. No harsh lines on this, just a great shade.  LOVE it.

They say to dampen your skin with warm water first, but I just put this straight onto my face before getting into the shower. It is soap-free so it won't dry out your skin. I've also used it as a moisturizing mask.

For a quick face cleanse try smoothing this luscious yet lightweight cream all over your face, just take a warm washcloth and wipe it all off. For a beneficial moisturizer, look up Avalon Active Organics Vitamin C Moisture Plus Lotion with SPF 15. It smells like freshly squeezed orange juice. In fact, the cream is very healing and you can use it anywhere on your body where you need healing.

489,"09 22, 2017",5.0,"Warm, soothing and a little spicy. This zum bar soap is perfect for fall weather. The creamy goat milk base makes it very moisturizing. I'm in love with all the zum bar soaps and keep trying new ones. This scent is the most comforting so far. I give these soaps away as gifts as well. This one would make a great holiday gift because of the frankincense and myrrh.

Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span.

560,"08 19, 2016",5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again",B0009RF9DW

766,"02 15, 2014",5.0,"I purchased this lotion in December 2013 while Christmas shopping.  I fell in love with it right away.  This is the nicest scented body lotion I've found in many years.  I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it's one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.  I will continue to check the store to see if more comes in, but will keep in mind that I can order it on Amazon, although it will cost more.  I would love to make this a regular part of my beauty regime.",B0009RF9DW

769,"01 19, 2014",5.0,"Victoria Secret had an amazing fragrance in this but has since discontinued it.  While this wasn't a cheap way to buy what of these remains, It was worth every penny being able to buy what is left of these on the market.  This scent is my all time favorite.",B0009RF9DW
770,"01 16, 2014",5.0,"I love Pure and Basic Body Wash in general, some scents better than others.  I wasn't sure about this one at first, I thought it was a faded scent, perhaps due to age.  And then, at some point, I got a whiff of my hand.  Wow.  Yum.  Yes, it's a foodie smell, but this one I like.

As for the cost, this container is almost 3x the size of the Pure and Basic regular sized containers, so I didn't feel the price was disproportionate, especially since this particular scent has been discontinued and is hard to find.",B0009RF9DW

Having used a wide array of skin care products and in particular body wash, I was delighted and surprised when I tried this one for the first time.

I like that this product is natural.",B0009RF9DW

797,"09 20, 2013",5.0,"This is pricey, but the results are worth it.  Skin feel silky and the aroma is wonderful.  Not much is needed for results, so it does last a long time.  I will keep coming back to buy it on Amazon because I have not found it locally.",B0009RF9DW
798,"09 19, 2013",5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",B0009RF9DW

800,"08 29, 2013",5.0,"I was skeptical about ordering this lotion because I didn't think it would smell like the actual perfume. WRONG!! It smells exactly like the Original J'Adore perfume. A bottle of J'Adore lotion is about $60.00,what a savings! This bottle of lotion is a good size too. I am very very happy with my purchase, I would give it 10 stars if I could! I am totally sold on Aura Intense. I will be ordering from this company again.",B0009RF9DW
801,"08 29, 2013",5.0,"I decided to purchase this for my husband as part of a gift because I love the ""Invigorating Tibetan"" version of this and it's every bit as gorgeous as the Tibetan shower gel but much milder and more on a light floral note whereas the Tibetan is more of a strong cologne scent. Very nice for baths before bedtime.",B0009RF9DW

806,"08 19, 2013",5.0,Dove no longer manufactures this body wash so I was relieved to find it on Amazon. The price is ridiculous but since I could not find it anywhere else I bought it.

809,"08 13, 2013",5.0,"I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product- especially when using it with the body lotion. I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it. However, other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $45  up to 95? I don't know why Bath & Body stopped selling it.",B0009RF9DW
810,"08 11, 2013",5.0,It makes taking a shower like a walk in a meadow of wild flowers.  Great consistency and viscosity.  Easy to get out of the bottle and spread on body.  Love the bubbles.,B0009RF9DW
811,"08 9, 2013",5.0,This cream smells incredible and has made my skin so soft.  Try the coordinating hand cream and massage cream.  Love it!,B0009RF9DW

813,"08 4, 2013",5.0,Years ago we discovered this bath/shower gel in various French hotels and fell in love with the scent.  I finally used up the last of my stash and was very glad to find it available in the U.S. so I no longer have to ask friends to bring it back for me.,B0009RF9DW

820,"07 12, 2013",5.0,"I have had multiple surgeries on my feet that have left long scars and using Vitamin E gel -- ONLY the pure gel, not other lotions with Vitamin E in them -- has significantly enhanced the reduction of the scars so that you can hardly notice them.

Highly recommend this product!",B0009RF9DW

825,"06 6, 2013",5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful. If you are a fan of Olay's orchid body wash, or a fan of orchid in general, definitely give this a try.",B0009RF9DW

831,"05 19, 2013",5.0,"The scent is very unique and luxurious. Very Euro...it combines the cleanness of modern scents with something ancient. I bought it for my husband, but i secretly love it for myself. I wish I had the cologne, but it cant be shipped to my FPO address.",B0009RF9DW

My roommate came over with a bottle of this stuff from Europe and whenever she would shower, I would wonder, ""What angel has fluttered down from the sky and walked into my life?"" ...because she smelt that good. SO today, I decided would be the day. I got drunk (because I can't do anything as daring), and stole her soap and took a shower in it. Only a wee bit. Like 3 dollops and I must say, OMG. I'll explain. You know, when you feel yourself hazy from an alcohol buzz, I was washed my face with it and when I opened my eyes, everything seemed brighter. THis stuff actually does revitalize. AND, I smell so expensive. I should probably go find another room to sleep in as I revel in this beauty. Because she will be able to tell immediately. She's cool though. She's Irish.",B0009RF9DW

As a cranberry-scented, foaming body wash, it's out of this world heavenly! Just so luscious it makes me hungry just smelling it. It's also thick and makes a LOT of lather with only a minor amount of the gel on a bath sponge.

852,"02 26, 2013",5.0,This wonderful fragrance is light and airy.  Lovely aroma that many ask what is that you are wearing. Hope you try it.,B0009RF9DW

854,"02 18, 2013",5.0,I have a sensitive nose when it comes to strong scents and sensitive skin to harsh products so Philosophy seemed like my best bet. I love it. This scent is mild but sweet. Leaves skin so soft. The lotion helps to keep the mild scent all day.,B0009RF9DW

856,"02 13, 2013",5.0,"My girlfreind loves this body wash, but in the stores it is a seasonal item.  I searched high and low for it, and thankfully I found it here, as well as cheaper than from B&BW.  Thanks!",B0009RF9DW
857,"02 11, 2013",5.0,"This lotion was purchased as a gift for my daughter, who loves the scent of bergamont. The fragrance is clean & fresh and lightly lingers on the skin for hours. I will be purchasing it again.",B0009RF9DW
858,"02 10, 2013",5.0,"Since the Thymes comany stopped production of the Filigree, I'm glad to have found a new source.  Their stock will probably run out too, But for the time being I'm thrilled to have my favorite fragrance available.",B0009RF9DW
859,"11 27, 2012",5.0,"I love this product!! I bought it for my mom for Christmas, and I haven't given it to her yet, but i love it so much and i'm sure she will too. I signed up for SMS messages, but sadly they weren't sent to me..grr! But, nevertheless, The box the shampoo&body wash is in is so beautiful, and it definitely can be reused. I loved read the philosophy written on the back (there's a picture of the bottles on the back of the box)The bow it was wrapped around was a bit flimsy, but it gave it a adorable home made look. And there's the cheesy title (I Heart You) which is perfect for a mother daughter moment :) Definitely recommending to  all of my friends.",B0009RF9DW
860,"11 11, 2012",5.0,"Don't just take my word for it, you must try it. A dear friend got me this from Italy 12 years ago and have been using it since, very hard to find it in the US. This shower cream will transform your shower experience, beautiful fragrance living your skin smooth and you will feel completely relax as if you just spent the day at the SPA, I LOVE it it's one luxurious treat for myself! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed but buy it as soon as you find it, like I said, very hard to find it in the US.",B0009RF9DW

862,"10 8, 2012",5.0,"I am a huge fan of Molton Brown products, especially the Travel Reviving Cempaka Bath & Shower gel. It's a bit pricey ($28-$30) but it's worth it...especially after long, stressful days.",B0009RF9DW

864,"09 5, 2012",5.0,"I had a hard time finding this product in the stores in my area. I was finally able to find it and I love it. My skin is so soft, not greasy or feeling like I need to take another shower to get it all off like so many body washes that I have used before. I have stocked up on this stuff just in case they decide to get rid of it in my store. I would highly reccomend this product to anybody that has dry itchy skin or any texture problems like I had. I no longer need to use heavy lotion and my skins clarity is much better.",B0009RF9DW
865,"08 15, 2012",5.0,"This soap has a very pleasant smell, but most importantly it is very concentrated and so you don't need to use as much soap (saving you money and resources).  I used this for medical reasons (jock itch) and found that the tea tree solution helps.  However Tea Tree is often very costly and to be able to buy this in bulk at such a good value... I would strongly recommend.",B0009RF9DW
866,"08 8, 2012",5.0,"I LOVE this product.!! It feels so good on your skin.

868,"07 28, 2012",5.0,I purchased Chanel Antaeus Bath and shower Gel.  The process was quick and easy and I received the product when promised.,B0009RF9DW
869,"07 11, 2012",5.0,"I just LOVE this body wash.  The smell is so fresh and clean, just what I was always searching for.  Too many other brands are just too floral or ""sweet"" for my taste, almost as though it's doubling as a perfume after the shower, but not this one.  It's so light and just...perfect.  I'm noticing a lot of reviews mentioning the reviewer's significant other loving the smell and I'm thinking maybe it's a guy thing to love a simple clean smell on a woman (not bathed in perfume) because my husband loves the faint smell of this body wash after I take a shower.  Last thing I'll mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.  After using this, I can either forgo the lotion after my shower or just use a light moisturizer.  Favorite body wash, hands down.",B0009RF9DW
870,"03 4, 2012",5.0,I use this for shaving. Constantly get questioned on what I am wearing.  Very light pleasant scent. Bought with the lotion.,B0009RF9DW
871,"02 11, 2011",5.0,"I have sensitive skin and I have to be careful what I use on my skin.  Many products make my skin itch and sometimes I'll get a red rash or blotches (sounds lovely, huh?!)  This shower gel is very gentle, does the job and doesn't make my skin itch nor cause a rash.  The only thing I woud suggest is that they leave out the fragrance or have a fragrance free option.  Although the send is not too strong and is a nice scent.",B0009RF9DW
872,"09 11, 2009",5.0,Best general purpose shampoo on the market. My wife says it produces a shine in her hair she can't get from any other product. Unique and lovely fragrance that characterizes the products in this line for both men and women.,B0009RF9DW
873,"08 20, 2009",5.0,"I've used Bellmira Herbaflor Herbal Baths for years and for a relaxing bubble bath, these are the Best Ever! The water here is Very Hard & this stuff still makes bubbles like no other I've ever found. Scents are Mild. A Must try.",B0009RF9DW
874,"08 3, 2009",5.0,"I purposely went online to ebay to try to find this product; when I did, I ordered 4 (for now and hope to find more later when I run out).  It has this warm, sexy scent to it - just like the name says, ""Amber Romance"" and the scrub is a perfect all-over body scrub - not too oily so you don't slip and kill yourself in the shower and doesn't have to be premixed like other scrubs.",B0009RF9DW
875,"01 7, 2009",5.0,"I love this brand because the ingredients are all good enough to eat, its Paraben free and best of all, no animal testing. I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

876,"05 20, 2006",5.0,"I love using shower gels and body washes in the shower in stead of soap for their fragrant lovely non drying consistency. This shower gel by Solstis is really unique; it smells like no other cosmetic I have ever used. Sure many items will try and smell like an ocean, with the wet green blue artificial scent, yet they do not compare to this one.

This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. It's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if I have entered a paradise island and Im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as I have never used a product that smelled this unique. At first this will smell faint, but using this with scrubby gloves or those bath poofs will yield luxe foam and a burst of some peaceful mineral rich island.",B0009RF9DW

And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one.",B000FI4S1E

943,"08 19, 2016",5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",B000FI4S1E

972,"04 19, 2016",5.0,"This is my family's favorite body wash, and I was excited to find it on Amazon, as the store I used to purchase it from no longer carries it. Wonderful smell and relaxing smell without being perfume-y; works great for showers to feel clean and for baths to relax.",B000FI4S1E
973,"03 30, 2016",5.0,"This bath gel is amazing. Silky smooth and not drying to the skin after a bath. Lathers very well. A little goes a long way, and it's totally pure and natural. Too bad the price on Amazon went up. Forced to buy else where.",B000FI4S1E
974,"03 25, 2016",5.0,"Tree Hut has so far not sold me a product I do not love. The Kiwi body wash is mild and fragrant and cleanses well. You don't need much to clean your entire surface, so it's worth the extra price of buying from this company. Very high-quality and I will continue to buy from Tree Hut.",B000FI4S1E

983,"02 22, 2016",5.0,"The soap is great, I only wish it was available in stores.  It's a little on the pricey side considering it's from Dial, and not some French, or Italian desinger, but when you seemingly can only get it online it's worth it.",B000FI4S1E

988,"02 13, 2016",5.0,The best soaking liquid you'll find.  I lived in Germany for quite some time and camomile was always recommended for skin irritations and dryness.  This Herbaflor is excellent and will leave your body soft and relaxed.  Stores that I would usually buy it from either don't carry it or no longer exist.  I also love that it leaves the bath tub with no residue.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.,B000FI4S1E

993,"01 26, 2016",5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it's one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.  I will continue to check the store to see if more comes in, but will keep in mind that I can order it on Amazon, although it will cost more.  I would love to make this a regular part of my beauty regime.",B000FI4S1E

And then, at some point, I got a whiff of my hand.  Wow.  Yum.  Yes, it's a foodie smell, but this one I like.

As for the cost, this container is almost 3x the size of the Pure and Basic regular sized containers, so I didn't feel the price was disproportionate, especially since this particular scent has been discontinued and is hard to find.",B000FI4S1E

1181,"09 19, 2013",5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",B000FI4S1E

1208,"06 6, 2013",5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful!

I'm noticing a lot of reviews mentioning the reviewer's significant other loving the smell and I'm thinking maybe it's a guy thing to love a simple clean smell on a woman (not bathed in perfume) because my husband loves the faint smell of this body wash after I take a shower.  Last thing I'll mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

This shower gel by Solstis is really unique; it smells like no other cosmetic I have ever used. Sure many items will try and smell like an ocean, with the wet green blue artificial scent, yet they do not compare to this one.

This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. It's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if I have entered a paradise island and Im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as I have never used a product that smelled this unique. At first this will smell faint, but using this with scrubby gloves or those bath poofs will yield luxe foam and a burst of some peaceful mineral rich island.",B000FI4S1E
1260,"05 3, 2011",5.0,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.

One small amusement: the carrying case has holders for four tips but the unit comes with six. Luckily the fifth wheel, as it were, fits in the carrying case even though there is no slot for it.

1267,"11 18, 2014",2.0,"I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",B000GLRREU
1268,"09 25, 2014",5.0,"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way.

1271,"05 29, 2012",5.0,"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.
The Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.",B000GLRREU
1272,"05 16, 2012",5.0,"I received this as a gift and just love it.  Make it your mouth, teeth and gums' best friend.  I had a much smaller water pick and although quite inexpensive, was decent enough.  It was a Yugo compared to this Lexus of water flossers!

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.",B000GLRREU
1273,"11 6, 2011",4.0,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",B000GLRREU
1274,"04 8, 2011",5.0,"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",B000GLRREU
1275,"03 1, 2008",5.0,"After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!",B000GLRREU
1276,"12 1, 2007",5.0,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",B000GLRREU
1277,"09 8, 2007",3.0,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",B000GLRREU
1278,"04 15, 2007",5.0,"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",B000GLRREU

On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

If you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again.",B000NKJIXM

Clearly they have had nerve damage on the insides of their mouths from using Listerine. Clearly.

Instead of the alcohol, which is a natural (and tasty) preservative, you get parabens.  The user should be aware of this, as some people claim they cause cancer (I'm too uninformed about that topic to state an opinion, but some people might wish to look into it).

Amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash I've ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  The ironic thing is that it says they don't use alcohol so that you don't get that burn.  Despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it's doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  Admittedly, that burn is slightly different.

1289,"04 11, 2013",4.0,"The mouthwash burn sensation in the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes is stronger than in some of the other Crest formulas, but is similar to the Scope mouthwash burn. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.

One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6.

1296,"04 6, 2013",3.0,"I thought this rinse might be a more palatable alternative to Listerine Total Care.  But with average performance and a questionable active ingredient, it is unlikely that I will use this again.

The rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. I did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. But my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. While it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. Moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. The bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. It claims such stains may be removed by brushing or ""at your next dental visit"". If my teeth suddenly browned, I don't think I would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. Dental visits don't rate high on my fun things to do list and I would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.

The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved.

He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work.

1300,"12 14, 2007",3.0,"Aside from a couple years in college I haven't used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.",B000PKKAGO
1301,"12 11, 2007",5.0,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.",B000PKKAGO

It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic.

It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis).

1503,"11 18, 2016",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,B000URXP6E

1537,"09 11, 2016",5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie.",B000URXP6E

1544,"08 19, 2016",5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",B000URXP6E

1692,"01 26, 2016",5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo.",B000URXP6E

I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.

I have been using it for about 1 week, and I have noticed my hair is soft and not wirey, from the bleach. I put it all over, minus my top roots and my hairline. This will only slightly weigh your hair down. My hair is past my hips, and I was not forced to cut it thanks to this product. I also, instead of rinsing straight away, let it sit overnight, washed it, and then repeated the process a few times. It's my new secret weapon against bleach breakage!!",B000URXP6E

  I am 74 years old and have very thick hair which most people my age would love to have as well as  a lot of young people, I believe using the right products may contribute to less hair loss.

I  have  been told you should not use the same shampoot all the time and switch every once in awhile and whenever I have tried other shampoos I immediately come back to  Kerastase.

 It is truly a wonderful shampoo",B000URXP6E

I don't use any other product other than the shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks like it has a natural curl to it.  I highly recommend Making Waves shampoo.,B000URXP6E

People often ask what I'm wearing and where they can get it.  The original Creme Perfume in a tube (from the 1980's & 1990's) is no longer available and neither is the Body Lotion.  I do wish Ungaro would bring those items back.

1985,"06 23, 2014",5.0,"I like the fact that I don't have a reaction since this is all organc , no chemicals, no pesticides, or preservatives and not tested on animals. The only downside is the travel pack is too small for a two week vacation, they are one ounce bottles enough for a weekend. I had to pack other 3 ounce bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. If if burts bees made this in a 3.4 oz travel (TSA regulations) then it would be great.

2000,"04 21, 2014",5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.",B000URXP6E

it yourself' you could tell where you was at on the curlers, because of the foam.  I have thin, fine,
naturally curly hair.  Because my hair is so thin and fine,  I wanted this perm mainly for body.  It worked really well for what I wanted.  Unfortunately I can't find it now.  Hope I can find it again.  I would recommend it to anyone.  (When I had my hair stylist used this perm, they was

I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it's one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.

2075,"09 19, 2013",5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",B000URXP6E

2105,"07 19, 2013",5.0,"I have fine hair that's oily at the crown and very dry brittle ends.  A year ago my stylist recommended the HBL products.  Now I can't live without them!  I use hydrating shampoo and the hair masque. Only a small dab needed.  The higher cost is made up for in value of the product. I occasionally change up shampoo by using the HBL volumizing shampoo.  With the hydrating I wash hair more quickly as it is rich but never leaves hair oily.  With the masque...I do use daily but I apply first at the brittle ends and then work up from there....basically only using the remaining residuals of the shampoo on my crown.  After washing I towel dry and after it begins to dry I then work into the dry ends, a pea sized amount of the HBL Shine and Seal.  Any residual on finger tips is lightly applied to areas with fly aways. My hair looks healthy and naturally shiny!  Products smell fresh and clean.",B000URXP6E

2116,"06 6, 2013",5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful.

SO today, I decided would be the day. I got drunk (because I can't do anything as daring), and stole her soap and took a shower in it. Only a wee bit. Like 3 dollops and I must say, OMG. I'll explain. You know, when you feel yourself hazy from an alcohol buzz, I was washed my face with it and when I opened my eyes, everything seemed brighter. THis stuff actually does revitalize.

2155,"01 17, 2008",3.0,"Let's think about this product for a minute.  You have a toothbrush which supposedly uses sonic waves to clean the teeth.  (I have to believe ""truth in advertising"" laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn't produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I've used.)  Then you get this item which is designed to sanitize said toothbrush.

How can you really tell if this thing ""sanitizes"" your toothbrush head?  Even if you tried to fake it by putting, say, spaghetti sauce on the toothbrush and then sanitizing it, that still doesn't prove anything.  It hums and then you take your brush head out.  But what are the benefits of sanitizing the brush head?  Again, I notice no difference in my mouth from how things were before I had this, compared to after using this.  So, it does nothing obvious, but if you're paranoid, you might want to get it just to believe you're chasing down every tiny bacterium.",B000V5Z4J6
2156,"12 26, 2007",5.0,"I'll give it five stars because it seems to do what it does well.  If you are concerned about the bacteria in your toothbrush and dipping it in alcohol isn't the answer for you then this product has your name written all over it.

I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  But since I don't use them, I can't comment on how well they work.

The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.

So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  What more could you ask for?

As a note, I do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  Namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  And I'd have to agree.  That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  Therefore, when I give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then I like to finish it off inside of this product.  It's all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/safer then it is worth every penny.",B000V5Z4J6
2157,"12 18, 2007",4.0,"You know how annoying it is to keep in mind that every 30-45 days you must throw away your old toothbrush and then find the same kind with the same either soft or medium head and it is never exactly the same and you have to get used to it again and then whole cycle repeats itself?

Well, no more. I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models). I didn't have troubles putting the holder into the Sanitizer. The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. It was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. This is a great gift for anyone in your family. Folks, it doesn't get any easier or more practical than this.",B000V5Z4J6
2158,"12 10, 2007",3.0,"I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).

That said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.
The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

This is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.
But I think I'll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer.",B000V5Z4J6

I like the famous Dr. Bronner's stuff, but wasn't feeling up to paying for it.  Dr. Woods, however, seems to provide as respectable a soap as one could ask for.  While any real faults in any of my experiments are probably due to the recipe itself, this ingredient has reacted as expected and I got to say I've had some great results.  When using this soap on its own, I've been impressed as well.  The almond aroma is not overwhelming, but clean and natural.

Without size options, I expect the size to be ""medium"" not extra large.  This is neither one-size-fits-all or one-size-fits-most.

The body-loving bath mitt has a terry made of rayon (so-called bamboo fiber that is claimed to be naturally antibacterial, but which is neither) on one side for gentle smoothing and jute loops on the other for more aggressive exfoliation.

The boucl mitt has a stretchy, open weave of unidentified fiber to provide moderate exfoliation.

In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

I washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them. The next time I used warm water that seemed to work better, with no detrimental effects to the gloves that I could see. They feel soft and hold up well.",B0010ZBORW

The booties are really just all natural unbleached cotton no-show socks, thin material probably fits all sizes up to a 10.5, Womens.

I used some lovely Judith Krantz moisturizer and slipped on the socks.  A couple of hours later, one was off, I kept it off to see the difference.  And there is a difference.

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did. The loofah arrives a little flat from packaging but swells up nice and round in the water. It is surprisingly soft in the water. It works great with body wash providing lots of suds.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door. It attaches securely and I haven't had any trouble with it slipping or sliding on the glass.",B0010ZBORW

You know what I mean - that men's locker room odor.  This one is about 5 inches long and has a little suction cup (and cloth loop) that you can hang to dry.  I actually hang mine on the curtain rod in front of my sunshiny bathroom window and it says fresh.

The material is nice and it was easy to blow up.  It is very soft to lay on, but you do have to have a place to let it dry, because the material is like a terry cloth material and it absorbs a lot of water.  I would only suggest ordering this if you have a bathtub that is slick, and not dimpled.  Porcelain or ceramic would be best.

I also think it's not really practical for an office; how many opportunities in an average office are there to give yourself the kind of pedicure in which toe separators and a callous file would be involved?

Sometimes, pumice stones are so rough that it makes them difficult to hold (as they can scratch up your inner hand and fingers when you are using them).

You only get one mitt which has a soft exfoliating surface that is less harsh than a loofah yet still exfoliates effectively.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic.

It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis).

2425,"11 18, 2016",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,B0012Y0ZG2

2459,"09 11, 2016",5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie.",B0012Y0ZG2

2466,"08 19, 2016",5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",B0012Y0ZG2

2614,"01 26, 2016",5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo.",B0012Y0ZG2

I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.

2921,"04 21, 2014",5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.

2996,"09 19, 2013",5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",B0012Y0ZG2

I use hydrating shampoo and the hair masque. Only a small dab needed.  The higher cost is made up for in value of the product. I occasionally change up shampoo by using the HBL volumizing shampoo.  With the hydrating I wash hair more quickly as it is rich but never leaves hair oily.  With the masque...I do use daily but I apply first at the brittle ends and then work up from there....basically only using the remaining residuals of the shampoo on my crown.  After washing I towel dry and after it begins to dry I then work into the dry ends, a pea sized amount of the HBL Shine and Seal.  Any residual on finger tips is lightly applied to areas with fly aways. My hair looks healthy and naturally shiny!  Products smell fresh and clean.",B0012Y0ZG2

3037,"06 6, 2013",5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful. If you are a fan of Olay's orchid body wash, or a fan of orchid in general, definitely give this a try.",B0012Y0ZG2

SO today, I decided would be the day. I got drunk (because I can't do anything as daring), and stole her soap and took a shower in it. Only a wee bit. Like 3 dollops and I must say, OMG. I'll explain. You know, when you feel yourself hazy from an alcohol buzz, I was washed my face with it and when I opened my eyes, everything seemed brighter. THis stuff actually does revitalize.

As a cranberry-scented, foaming body wash, it's out of this world heavenly! Just so luscious it makes me hungry just smelling it. It's also thick and makes a LOT of lather with only a minor amount of the gel on a bath sponge.

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",B0012Y0ZG2

This one has a similar impact. I use it as body wash too, but if you do it I recommend using a loofa to increase the longevity of the bottle. I've been using mine for four months and it only just now ran out. I have used it conservatively, maybe two times or three a week.

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

Simply use your favorite oil or moisturizer and then slip on these gloves. They keep the creams or oils on your hands instead of having it get all over the bedding while you sleep. In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

I washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them. The next time I used warm water that seemed to work better, with no detrimental effects to the gloves that I could see. They feel soft and hold up well.",B0010ZBORW

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did. The loofah arrives a little flat from packaging but swells up nice and round in the water. It is surprisingly soft in the water. It works great with body wash providing lots of suds.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door. It attaches securely and I haven't had any trouble with it slipping or sliding on the glass.",B0010ZBORW

You know what I mean - that men's locker room odor.  This one is about 5 inches long and has a little suction cup (and cloth loop) that you can hang to dry.

The material is nice and it was easy to blow up.  It is very soft to lay on, but you do have to have a place to let it dry, because the material is like a terry cloth material and it absorbs a lot of water.  I would only suggest ordering this if you have a bathtub that is slick, and not dimpled.  Porcelain or ceramic would be best.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic.

It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis).

3415,"11 18, 2016",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,B0012Y0ZG2

3449,"09 11, 2016",5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie.",B0012Y0ZG2
3450,"09 5, 2016",5.0,Seems to work as usual.,B0012Y0ZG2
3451,"09 2, 2016",3.0,"This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon anymore, you can only find it online. It is a great product if you are looking for a shine. It did not work well as an anti-frizz product.",B0012Y0ZG2

3456,"08 19, 2016",5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",B0012Y0ZG2

The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.",B0012Y0ZG2

3604,"01 26, 2016",5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo.",B0012Y0ZG2

3631,"11 17, 2015",5.0,"I love this scent, and it's no longer being made.
I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.
If the fragrance gods are listening, please recreate this or something like it! I always get compliments on it.",B0012Y0ZG2

This will only slightly weigh your hair down. My hair is past my hips, and I was not forced to cut it thanks to this product.

3911,"04 21, 2014",5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.",B0012Y0ZG2

I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it's one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.

3986,"09 19, 2013",5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",B0012Y0ZG2

I use hydrating shampoo and the hair masque. Only a small dab needed.  The higher cost is made up for in value of the product. I occasionally change up shampoo by using the HBL volumizing shampoo.  With the hydrating I wash hair more quickly as it is rich but never leaves hair oily.  With the masque...I do use daily but I apply first at the brittle ends and then work up from there....basically only using the remaining residuals of the shampoo on my crown.  After washing I towel dry and after it begins to dry I then work into the dry ends, a pea sized amount of the HBL Shine and Seal.  Any residual on finger tips is lightly applied to areas with fly aways. My hair looks healthy and naturally shiny!  Products smell fresh and clean.",B0012Y0ZG2

4022,"07 4, 2013",5.0,Would buy more of the body cream if moire was available.  This body cream is hard to come by.  I buy anytime I find on a site.  Lotion is easily available but the body cream is difficult to obtain.  This is my signature fragrance.,B0012Y0ZG2

4027,"06 6, 2013",5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful. If you are a fan of Olay's orchid body wash, or a fan of orchid in general, definitely give this a try.",B0012Y0ZG2

My roommate came over with a bottle of this stuff from Europe and whenever she would shower, I would wonder, ""What angel has fluttered down from the sky and walked into my life?"" ...because she smelt that good. SO today, I decided would be the day. I got drunk (because I can't do anything as daring), and stole her soap and took a shower in it. Only a wee bit. Like 3 dollops and I must say, OMG. I'll explain. You know, when you feel yourself hazy from an alcohol buzz, I was washed my face with it and when I opened my eyes, everything seemed brighter. THis stuff actually does revitalize.

As a cranberry-scented, foaming body wash, it's out of this world heavenly! Just so luscious it makes me hungry just smelling it. It's also thick and makes a LOT of lather with only a minor amount of the gel on a bath sponge.

4067,"02 13, 2013",5.0,"~BACKGROUND~
We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",B0012Y0ZG2

This one has a similar impact. I use it as body wash too, but if you do it I recommend using a loofa to increase the longevity of the bottle. I've been using mine for four months and it only just now ran out. I have used it conservatively, maybe two times or three a week.

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

It also has a good tip on conserving water. I knew that it saves water to turn off the tap when you are brushing but I had no idea that it can save up to 4 gallons of water.",B001ET7FZE

It reminded me of the bubblegum-flavored paste I used as a kid, though I didn't get any fruit flavors. Regardless, it's mild enough that even my picky kid - who hates ""spicy"" paste - liked this.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

It's been years since I've used a pump, and I forgot how much I liked them. This is virtually mess free, with a red button easy enough for my daughter to use in her own. All in all, I was extremely impressed by this toothpaste and might even use it from time to time myself. Recommended.",B001ET7FZE

Bubblegum (ahem, bubble fruit) isn't her favorite flavor, but she says it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the pump action because it's less mess than traditional tubes.

You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

This is not the cheapest floss out there, but it really is the only one I can stand to use.  I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)

I started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't even notice the change from original Glide (GoreTex) to the current product.  Well, I noticed the package was different, I suppose, but I felt like the product was still quite good.

This floss is more like a tape than conventional floss, and just slips through the tightest spots without any difficulty. It's also very comfortable on the gum line, and rarely breaks in use.

Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

4171,"09 16, 2017",5.0,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",B001LNODUS

Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",B001LNODUS

When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time.

You can definitely use it on clean linens, but I also use it to freshen things like the bathroom rug and the shower curtain between washings. You can use this delightful spray on pretty much anything you can spray water on. It's great sprayed in drawers and in closets, too. The smell is so light and fresh, I even caught my granddaughter using it to slightly dampen her hair before using the curling iron! What a smart girl. I absolutely adore the Pre De Provence product line. Everyone of them is made with high quality and wonderful scents. This Lavender Blossom Water is no exception. It's a nice way to bring a touch of Provence into your own home.",B001LNODUS
4196,"08 30, 2017",4.0,"I am reviewing the Bath Salts.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender bath salts come in a plastic 19 ounce container with a screw lid.  There is no protective seal on the product bottle.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

The only reason I subtracted a star is because I had to give my tub an extra rinse after taking my Lavender incensed bath with these salts.",B001LNODUS

4333,"11 18, 2016",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,B001OHV1H4

They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.

I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo.",B001OHV1H4

I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.

This will only slightly weigh your hair down. My hair is past my hips, and I was not forced to cut it thanks to this product.

4621,"04 21, 2014",5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.",B001OHV1H4

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",B001OHV1H4

This one has a similar impact. I use it as body wash too, but if you do it I recommend using a loofa to increase the longevity of the bottle.

If you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.

The holder is a good size and even fits a thick bar of soap. The Velcro closure works very well to firmly keep the soap inside the sleeve. The soft washing side provides a nice bubbly lather. The exfoliating side, however, if pretty rough, even using a soft touch. I really can't use it as it hurts to the point of leaving scratches on my skin. But the most concerning part about this soap envelope, however, is that it doesn't dry between showers, and that doesn't seem sanitary.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife.

4695,"09 4, 2017",3.0,"Obviously, cellulite is not affected by a brush. Simple biology reveals the massive flaws in this idea. If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

4698,"08 28, 2016",5.0,"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.",B002RZZXYE

Now I can see why! This has to be the fastest and most potent skin care product I've ever tried.

The product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.

My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.

Wow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby's bottom.

This tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house.

It seems to have a ton of uses; I've been applying it not only on those patches on my hand, but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre-cancerous patches also), on my lips, on my heels at night, and also on my cuticles.

My dentist has me using a fluoride toothpaste at night. I use this after meals in the morning and evening.  This seems like a good compliment to the toothpaste since a liquid will get to hard to reach places a toothpaste will not.

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",B00B7V273E

Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.

4730,"11 18, 2014",2.0,"I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",B000FOI48G
4731,"09 25, 2014",5.0,"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way.

4734,"05 29, 2012",5.0,"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.
The Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.",B000FOI48G

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.",B000FOI48G
4736,"11 6, 2011",4.0,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",B000FOI48G
4737,"04 8, 2011",5.0,"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",B000FOI48G

The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.

4739,"12 1, 2007",5.0,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",B000FOI48G
4740,"09 8, 2007",3.0,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",B000FOI48G

The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",B00CZH3K1C
4743,"12 4, 2013",5.0,"The Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.

There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.",B00CZH3K1C
4744,"12 2, 2013",5.0,"Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

I do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.",B00CZH3K1C
4745,"11 26, 2013",5.0,"If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I's snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.

After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.

On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains ""propylparaben"" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.

Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)

I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

For me, it translated as ""pleasant"" and ""clean"" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister.

So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.

I used it with additional styling products and without (just the conditioning mousse).

I used it with a large Spornette brush and a smaller Conair brush.

My hair feels full and looks full and lightweight.  It holds that fullness without any heaviness throughout the day.

My hair felt conditioned.

Upon arising the next morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my hair still looked full and light with just a tiny bit of finger fluffing.

It is an additional boost to have the conditioner and mousse in one application and worth its cost.

4774,"08 17, 2014",5.0,"To starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others. Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it's definitely made for her hair type more than my own.",B00EYZY6LQ
4775,"08 16, 2014",4.0,"This Fekkai Foam Conditioner is unusual for a foam in that the directions say to apply to wet hair after washing, wait 2 - 3 minutes and then rinse out.

It worked pretty well but left just a slight bit of heaviness to my fine hair.  Then I read the directions which I should have done before using it. The next couple times I used it as instructed and I liked the results better. It seemed to add a little volume and body to my fine hair. It didn't do a super job of detangling though. The foam is very full and luxurious. The dispensing mechanism is nice because it puts quite a large amount in your hand with only a light touch. It makes it very easy to use.

I love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus. It's very natural scent, not like something cooked up in a lab. It's one of my favorite things about the product. After drying my hair the fragrance went away so I wouldn't have to worry about it conflicting with my cologne.",B00EYZY6LQ

Anything that keeps my hair from looking limp and almost plastered to my head is a real winner for me. This product went beyond the basic fullness I was hoping for.

I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out. Awesome. This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly. It doesn't feel heavy and thick like some other conditioners.

The conditioner itself smells amazing. It leaves a nice citrus aroma in your hair. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day. After about an hour or so, I can no longer smell it. It does leave my hair feeling amazing. I didn't notice a huge volume improvement, but my hair is pretty thick to begin with. It did help with my frizz and my tangles.

I do have very fine hair and this works great. I wouldn't recommend it for thick hair - you'd have to use far too much of it. But for thin hair that gets limp fast if the product has too much wax/silicates, this gives volume without weighing down hair.  I didn't have to use a lot of styling products afterwards that always seem to make my thin hair stiffen and flatten.

A small ball rapidly expands as you put it in your hair, so a little goes a lot way.  I use this on days when I need a bit of extra conditioning - for meetings and such.  It is more expensive than store bought conditions but on par with salon varieties.  And I do trust the Fekkai name.",B00EYZY6LQ

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around.

You place one in your mouth on the gum line, outside of the tongue area, next to the aching tooth and leave in place for ten minutes. The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

I highly recommended the product and think it would be a great addition to any home medicine cabinet or first aid kit",B00L1I1VMG
4790,"10 2, 2014",5.0,"Great product. Will take a few weeks to see how it works, but I have sensitive teeth, and it hasn't made them worse, so fingers crossed. YMMV, of course.",B00L1I1VMG
4791,"09 25, 2014",4.0,"I noticed a difference the next day, after I used these.  I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

I am going to try these a week before my next dental cleaning, in January.  If I notice a difference, I will come back and change my review to 5 stars, and you will all be hearing about it!  For now, I recommend giving these a try.",B00L1I1VMG
4792,"09 24, 2014",4.0,"A few years ago I was head butted by a pit bull while volunteering at an animal shelter. No damage according to my dentist but I do suffer from occasional sensitivity in the area where I was hit. I've used specialized toothpaste but the transient nature of the sensitivity makes it hard to justify.  These tabs do seem to provide relief. They are small and adhere without issue. Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour. The effect is supposed to last for up to a month.

So far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes. They don't cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places. I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn't crack or cavity. But all in all, a fast and effective way to get some relief from sensitivity.",B00L1I1VMG
4793,"09 23, 2014",3.0,"I wore braces for several years as an adult and one of the most alarming things was my new sensitivity to cold. (I managed to get over the sensitivity to jalapenos.)  I used to love ice cream.  I used to chomp on ice chips.  But when my braces were on, I had to microwave ice cream - even though I have previously made fun of people for doing that.  Sometimes Karma just turns around and bites.

I was looking forward to the braces coming off for a lot of reasons but at least one of them was to chomp on a popsicle.  OOPS.  NOPE.

I was really hoping these Sensi-stop strips would work.  My dentist suggested using them again -- after she repairs a fracture in a tooth -- to see if it would help.  She also wants to know.",B00L1I1VMG

They're more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes). They are just small strips, meant for applying to portions of your mouth. It's not a whole mouth piece for all your teeth. The directions mention it might take a few treatments to get the desired level of sensitivity relief, with at least one day between treatments.",B00L1I1VMG

Never have I seen this product at my local store, so was happy to test it out.
Crest certainly knows about oral care, this product is easy to apply, and most importantly, it works. Unlike the Sensodyne, it works right away. Very pleased to have found a new way to address a common problem",B00L1I1VMG
4796,"08 4, 2017",5.0,"I have this in ""Berry Seductive"" but I've had a great experience with it and would certainly purchase it in other colors.

As you can see from the product image, this comes with two products -- a lip stain and a balm -- in one container.  I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.

I gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

I did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.

The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.

Overall, I'm very happy with this product.  Definitely glad I bought it.",B00MGK9Z8U

4798,"04 10, 2015",5.0,"This is another great Pantene product. I only use a conditioner when I have a new perm because they tend to dry out my hair, and this really helps.  My granddaughters have long hair.  They always use a conditioner, and this works great for them too.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.",B00N2WQ2IW
4799,"04 10, 2015",5.0,"I like the Pantene Color protect shampoo, but the conditioner that goes with it is not a great match with my hair. Tends to leave me looking flat and a feeling a little dry, so I use a couple of other brands in rotation. This Pantene Volume version may very well be the answer. It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume. It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet. Once dry, my hair looks great! I have thick, lush hair that reaches the middle of my back in a blunt cut - no layers here. The wrong conditioner can make my hair look like a curtain. Nobody wants that. My hair is shiny, floaty and looks like I spent more than three minutes brushing it this morning. I did not. I'm not only surprised, I am really happy. I'll totally buy this in the future.",B00N2WQ2IW
4800,"04 9, 2015",4.0,"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn't need so much in the way of shine enhancement.",B00N2WQ2IW
4801,"04 9, 2015",4.0,"Overall a decent, daily conditioner from Pantene. The signature feature with this product is its 'sheer volume' aspect carried out by a 'collagen plumping effect.' The end result is a well performing weightless conditioner that does add tangible volume and lift and becomes even more pronounced if blow drying is performed immediately after.

A small dab is all that is needed to adequately work through the hair. The product easily rinses out and does leave a nice, silky finish that holds up for hours on untreated hair.  There is a pronounced sweet berry fragrance that may or may not be too your liking but all told, its fairly pleasant and unobtrusive.",B00N2WQ2IW
4802,"04 19, 2015",4.0,"This is nice, rich conditioner and great for detangling, though I would prefer less fragrance. It did not interfere with my curls, either. You don't need to use much, and you do need to rinse well.",B00N2WQ2IW

It has a nice fragrance that I would call ""flowery"" that leaves behind a mild fragrance after drying. I've always liked Pantene's shampoo and conditioner fragrances.

The thing I like best about this conditioner is that it leaves my hair tangle-free after conditioning. If I don't use a conditioner at all, my hair is just a tangled mess that is very difficult to comb out. The texture even feels different. This conditioner leaves it feeling smooth even when it's still wet. It's a good product at a reasonable price.",B00N2WQ2IW

Out with the Clinique, even out with the blue bottles, it must all go.  Now here is another product that is better than any of the Clinique products I depended on and at a fraction of the cost.

This is a retinol serum.  I use it on my clean skin before I put moisturizer on in the morning and at night.  .  I think that it multiplies the effect of a moisturizer by making it easier to absorb.  After six weeks of using this, my skin has a better texture and feels softer.  I don't see the finer lines on my skin.

I have always been careful to use quality products on my face for the past thirty years and this is one of the best lines of products.  These are products that are the same quality, but at a much lower price.  It's just amazing.

I can smell a hint of it in the bathroom, but very faint and soft, and not at all on my skin after showering.
The bar itself is large, and it took a little extra grip from the usual bath size bars I use. But, the formula is creamy and smooth, lathers nicely and doesn't leave my skin dry. I can't say it's the most moisturizing of bars, but it feels really nice and rinses completely.

If you like to keep scented soaps in your lingerie drawer for a short time before using them to wash with, take this soap and go straight to the shower or bath.
That old fashioned way of scenting your clothes won't work with this one.
You will, however, really appreciate it in terms of cleaning your skin without stripping down all of the natural oils that keep us nice and soft. Patchouli is also a terrific scent for any gender. Even though the fragrance is not strong, a light Patchouli does come across while you're bathing.
The generously-sized bar lasts a nice long time.",B00W259T7G
4845,"09 29, 2017",4.0,"I have another brand of bar soap with a much more potent patchouli fragrance.  I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

4846,"09 29, 2017",4.0,"I love Pre de Provence bar soaps, and I love sandalwood.  By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sandalwood-100-Pure-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B00112DRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

Don't quite bury your nose in the bubbles, but let the effervescence tickle and tingle you nose.  Take a sip.  Feel the ocean spray, breath in the salty brine.  Okay, you got it:  That is the fragrance of the Pre de Provence Sea Salt bar soap.

It is brisk and bracing.  It is not sweetish, but just a touch sweet.  It is citrus-y and lime-y.  If the effervescence had a smell, this would be it.  (Do NOT dare think fish--think fresh, and of the sea.  It also has some ginger in it.  Not the warming gingerbread fragrance, but the bright and zingy scent of just chopped, fresh ginger root.

It doesn't irritate my skin, but like other Pre de Provence soaps, it cleans so well that it can leave it feeling a little dry. I would definitely get it again, but just wish it smelled more strongly of sandalwood.

Happily, this PRE DE PROVENCE SEA SALT FRENCH SOAP BAR (150g, 5.2 Ounce) is no different from the other Pre de Provence soaps--it smells wonderful, and produces a rich, thick lather.

The fragrance is hard to describe.  Its kind of floral, but maybe is best described as fresh sea breeze.  It makes one think of fresh air and sunshine.  The fragrance doesn't linger overlong.  The soap doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, but may be a little more drying than other Pre de Provence soaps (unless it's my imagination working overtime).

The soap definitely contains salt. The ingredients are:  sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate, water, fragrance, palm acid, titanium dioxide, glycerin, palm kernel acid, SODIUM CHLORIDE, shea butter, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium edta, tetrasodium etidronate, benzyl salicylate, linalool, geraniol, citral.",B00W259T7G

4858,"09 21, 2017",5.0,"If you love the scent of Patchouli plants and oils, you will love this soap!  This is a huge bar of soap.  It measures 4 inches wide and is 2.5 inches high and over an inch thick.  It is a light cocoa color with engravings on both sides of the bar.  The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.

To me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of ""Dead Heads,"" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

This soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

While women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.

This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  It makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.  Heaven probably smells a little like Patchouli and the scent is captured in this bar of soap.  It's fantastic.",B00W259T7G

After using my skin felt tight and itchy and to calm it I had to use a total body lotion after the shower. This soap arrived in a clear plastic wrap with no labeling at all without an ingredient list. The scent to me is of citrus and I suspect the natural oils of the citrus fruits in the fragrance are what is oil-stripping my skin and leaving me with dried out skin.

I'm surprised at how long he bar is lasting. While I don't find anything exceptional about this soap, I like it.",B00W259T7G
4861,"09 8, 2017",5.0,"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.",B00W259T7G
4862,"09 7, 2017",5.0,"Pr de Provence is known for the large blocks of savon de Marseille made with olive oil that are especially suited for use in the kitchen, but these newer artisanal bars are easier to handle.  They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.  The milk, coconut, and green tea are more subdued fragrances and are a good choice for people who don't like strong fragrances.

A Dial bar lasts about a week at our house with two boys. This is harder and doesn't turn to mush.  I see that as a benefit just as it will last longer.

Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.

It seems way too close to that typical ""man's smell"" that disgraces so many products and dudes all over the world.  I mean, it's definitely a higher end version of this smell than, say, Axe body spray or something terrible like that, but it's in that general realm.

4893,"09 1, 2017",5.0,"This is wonderful soap. It is so creamy and milky and wonderful. It does have a scent, but in the way plain goat milk soap has a scent. It smells soft and creamy. Not like vanilla. More fresh. It lathers well and leaves skin feeling soft and clean. It almost smells like baby soap, not a baby powder scent, but like high end baby soap. I really like it. The bar is nicely engraved and pretty, as well.",B00W259T7G

4895,"09 1, 2017",4.0,"This seems to be a pretty high quality soap as far as feel goes, and how slowly it disintegrates.  However, I do not love it because I do not like the smell that it has.  It seems way too close to that typical ""man's smell"" that disgraces so many products and dudes all over the world.  I mean, it's definitely a higher end version of this smell than, say, Axe body spray or something terrible like that, but it's in that general realm.  It is possible that this smell comes from a real style soap like this and is later stolen by all the cheap brands, but for better or worse, I still don't like it due to all the cheap brands out there using it.",B00W259T7G
4896,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"This soap smells absolutely wonderful. I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.

This soap lathers really well and seems to be fairly hard milled since it isn't shrinking too fast, even with repeated use.",B00W259T7G
4897,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"I love my soaps and this one is excellent.  It has a nice clean rosemary mint scent that doesn't smell 'fake' as so many do.  There are little bits of mint in the soap you can actually see but won't stick to you when washing.  I prefer French milled because they lather easily and are smooth - cheaper soaps never lather easily and you have to spend forever trying to get enough on your hands.  The shea butter leaves skin moisturized but not sticky or feeling like there is a residue left after exiting the show.  In all, I'm very pleased!",B00W259T7G
4898,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"This soap smells soooo good. It lathers decently and the shea butter left my skin feeling soft. I will say, this is more of a spa soap than an I'm ready dirty and need a bath kind of soap. But seriously, the raspberry smells soooo good!",B00W259T7G
4899,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"The 150 gram bar of Mint Leaf Pre de Provence Shea Butter Soap is delightful. The soap has little bits of mint leaf in the bar that you can see. The soap is great for bathing with or even washing your face because it has shea butter as part of the ingredients. It also has fragrance added, which helps enhance the aroma from the soap. This is a French milled soap and you can feel the difference when you wash your hands or your body. This is a luxury soap and will make wonderful gifts also. I do not have a single negative thing to say about this soap. The soaps come in 150 and 250 gram sizes. These are the soaps you want to soak in the tub with and enjoy the feel, the scent and the calmness from the scents.",B00W259T7G
4900,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"Great smell, solid bar of soap that doesn't dry out my skin.  I prefer bar soaps because they last long and because there is no plastic bottle to add to the landfill.  This is a very large bar of soap that if left in a dry area, will last a good amount of time.",B00W259T7G
4901,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"This is a medium-sized bar of hard soap with a pleasant lemon scent. I have sensitive skin, and this soap does not irritate it. Perfect for the tub, sink, or a luxury gift.",B00W259T7G
4902,"08 31, 2017",5.0,"Mirabelle scented soap from Pre de Provence smells wonderful! The scent is hard to describe. It smells a little floral and a little spicy on the bar. When I shower with it, I pick up more of a sandalwood scent. The scent is very strong from the bar and I smell it in the bathroom, but it doesn't linger on the skin so it won't clash with your perfume. The soap leaves my skin feeling very clean and it doesn't dry it out.

I've used Pre de Provence soaps in the past and have always had good luck with them. The soap is hard milled and doesn't melt away too quickly. I have a wooden Pre de Provence retail display box that is about 10 years old and it still smells like their soap. My grandmother used to tuck scented soaps in her dresser drawers to keep her linens smelling fresh. This soap would be perfect for that.",B00W259T7G
4903,"08 30, 2017",5.0,Oooh la la! This French soap is fabulous! The fragrance is mild and clean scented. It makes my skin feel silky soft from the shea butter. The large bar should last a long time. This is great quality and would make a good gift too.,B00W259T7G
4904,"08 30, 2017",5.0,"The Linden soap is an absolute delight. OMG it smells so very good. Honestly I'm not really sure what Linden is, but oh, I so love this!
Quality of the soap is high, I find it more delicately scented and just a better quality soap than Lush soaps.
These soaps are great for home use, as a guesting gift, or anything really.
Five stars!",B00W259T7G
4905,"08 30, 2017",5.0,"I have used Pre de Provence soaps in the past, and they are absolutely wonderful. There is no comparison to an ordinary bar of soap. They are hard milled, and each bar lasts a long time. The lather is perfect. The scent is delicious and uplifting. And these soaps are packed with so many emollients, they actually moisturize your skin instead of drying it out like a regular bar of soap. The Mirabelle scent is lovely. It is slightly floral and sweet, with an undernote of citrus. I definitely recommend that you try these soaps in the fragrance of your choosing. You won't go back to using supermarket or drugstore brand soaps. There is no comparison. A single bar of this soap,  or a collection of them, make a wonderful gift, too. Enjoy!",B00W259T7G
4906,"08 29, 2017",5.0,This is very high quality soap.  It has a wonderful scent.  It lathers well and rinses clean.  It left my skin feeling moisturized and not the least bit dried out.  It is very good soap!,B00W259T7G
4907,"08 29, 2017",5.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap!!! These are thick heavy bars that are beautiful, smell wonderful, and create a nice soft lather. They look and feel luxurious and they're large, so they'll last a long time. I am so impressed. Every one of them (I have several types) is wonderful. The coconut feels especially soft and soothing. The raspberry is a gorgeous color. They leave a faint scent in my bathroom which makes it smell delicious. There is nothing negative to say. I've very pleased. These would be great for gifts.",B00W259T7G
4908,"08 29, 2017",5.0,"Review for Starflower:

This is a nice bar of soap. It has a hard consistency, not a soft bar so it seems to last longer. The soap provides a lot of suds which makes you feel like you are getting clean. It is a large size too which my husband really loves.

I had never smelled starflower before. The scent of the soap is a floral but not in a heavy or sweet type scent, it smells nothing like roses or magnolias but is just clean floral scent. Im not a big fan of florals and this one is ok, my husband doesnt care for anything girly scented and he doesnt mind this one either.",B00W259T7G
4909,"08 29, 2017",5.0,"French milled soap and glycerine soaps are a weakness of mine, especially is they are pretty and smell great. This is a great moisturizing formula.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

This formula is skin-friendly and I like that the fragrance is not overpowering. I can't wait to try other fragrances!",B00W259T7G
4910,"08 29, 2017",5.0,"This is unmistakably French soap. It smells wonderful without being perfumey, it's oversized, and is the most beautiful snowy white.

It lathers well, and leaves skin soft.  It's an excellent soap to travel with, and that marvelous thing, an affordable luxury.",B00W259T7G
4911,"08 29, 2017",4.0,"I'm new to the Pre de Provence brand, but tried the Green Tea scented Shea Butter soap.  It doesn't have a green tea scent but it does have a light, clean and slightly sweet smell.  The soap feels gentle on the skin. It doesn't lather like commercially produced soap.  The bar doesn't dissolve as quickly as Dove or similar soap.",B00W259T7G
4912,"08 29, 2017",5.0,"I love Artisanal soaps and pick them up at Whole Foods quite often.  They really help me to feel spoiled and pampered.

Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisinal soap is fancy soap that doesn't cost a  lot of money.  It comes wrapped in a clear cellophane wrapper, which is more than most atisan soaps have.  Many Artisan soaps come without any packaging.

My bar of soap weighs just under 6 ounces.  It's over an inch thick and 3.5 inches long.  Good sized bar of soap.  Mine is mint green with brown flecks.  I am reminded of mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's Rosemary mint.  I love mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions.  The mint is a great eye opener and invigorates tired bones.

The soap lathers up nicely and rinses off well.  I feel no residue.  It looks great in my bathroom.  I would buy this soap if I saw it in the store.  Great fragrance and artisan look.",B00W259T7G
4913,"08 29, 2017",5.0,Nice delicious soothing Pre' de Provence soap that leaves your skin clean with mild fragrance to boot.  I can feel the Shea Butter as I larger up the soap and my skin absorbs and reflects the best about the soap.  Highly recommend!,B00W259T7G
4914,"08 29, 2017",5.0,"Growing up my grandmother always had french milled soap in the guest room and to this day, it reminds me of her. This shea butter enriched version is different - not bad but just different. I actually like the fact it feels soothing and yet leaves skin feeling squeeky clean without any type of residue. This is long lasting but not as much as the standard milled soap I knew growing up. Nice fragrance - not overpowering but present. I actually added a different scent to my subscribe and save since I liked this so well.",B00W259T7G
4915,"08 28, 2017",5.0,"These are glorious oversized bars of heaven! I have the green tea version and the fragrance is delicious! It almost has a bit of spiciness to it. Moreover, these leave a clean but not ""stripped"" or dry feeling. And, if you are careful, these won't just melt away in the shower. (If you have a little in-shower case, all the better).

This smells phenomenal, it cleans without drying, and the bars a HUGE! Everything about these is outstanding!

Highly, highly recommended!",B00W259T7G
4916,"08 28, 2017",3.0,"The soap itself is fine, the scent itself reminds me of old ladies. No offense but I just don't like it at all. This is definitely larger than most finer soaps and the scent doesn't linger too long but it doesn't go away that quickly either. I would give this soap 4 stars if it weren't for the horrible scent.",B00W259T7G
4917,"08 28, 2017",5.0,"I will most definitely be back for more! This soap is the most unusual bar soap I have ever used. Just the weight of the bar tells you it is different from anything you've ever picked up in the drug store. The lather is rich, the scent lingers but in a very soft way, and it simply left me feeling so fresh. Slowly but surely, I'll be trying every scent in this line. I'd love to use them as sachet to give that same subtle freshness to my clothing!",B00W259T7G
4918,"08 28, 2017",4.0,"This is truly fine soap, and lathers as expected. It has not caused irritation on any user in our circle. The scent is very strong--one expects a slice of Key lime pie in the offing, and it does linger.",B00W259T7G
4919,"08 28, 2017",5.0,I love soap with shea butter in it. I knew before that it is great for as moisturizer but I looked up and found that it dates back to the times of Cleopatra and actually has many uses like in some ointments. The smell is great but does not linger. I think it is great for everyone who has dry skin.,B00W259T7G
4920,"08 28, 2017",4.0,"I have the tiare scent of this bar soap. It's not a scent that I can easily break down. It makes me think of brown sugar, lavender and coco butter. The scent is way too sweet for me, but it doesn't linger long.

The soap itself is smooth and lathers pretty well. It is very soft, feels nice on the skin and does actually clean you off. I found that I needed to rinse a little more than usual to get the last residue of it off though. (We don't have soft water) I like this, but I am not convinced it's any better than a regular soap for a lot less money.",B00W259T7G
4921,"08 28, 2017",5.0,"I've been using Pre de Provence bar soaps for about six months now and I really like them (my favorites are the verbena and the rosemary mint). This is the first bar of ""Peony"" I've tried and it's very good. Given the name, it's no surprise it's a floral scent; I'd say it leans more feminine than masculine, but I'd also say its unisex if you like soft florals.

The nice thing about all the Pre de Provence soaps I've tried is that the scents are there when you're showering, but they don't linger so strongly that they'll clash with your cologne later on. For the price, they're excellent soaps.",B00W259T7G
4922,"08 26, 2017",5.0,"This has a delightful fragrance! Floral, but much more interesting than the usual floral scents. The performance is also top-notch with a nice amount of lather and a very creamy feel. It does not dry out my skin at all.

The price makes it more of a ""treat"" than an everyday soap, but it's a very nice treat indeed.",B00W259T7G
4923,"08 26, 2017",5.0,"This arrived really fast.
At first, I thought that the smell might be too much for a macho dude like me :-) but it didn't linger on me after my shower. Great lather, smoooooth and refreshing, and cleans nicely, even paint primer on my hands.

4935,"08 24, 2015",5.0,"Pre de Provence does an exceptional job of combining fragrant essential oils and a wide array of plant oils to create the most enticing and luxurious body-pampering products that I've ever experienced.  I've been a fan for years.  Pre de Provence has greatly expanded their line over the past few years, and more and more of them are showing up on Amazon.  To have such wonderful French products available here at the touch of my computer screen is a real treat!
This line of soaps with Shea butter is especially comforting and gratifying.  I tried the lavender fragrance in this line and it is very fragrant.  It is floral and spicy and not cloyingly sweet.  It is a sophisticated fragrance, and it is potent and true lavender.  Just lovely!

The shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the ""artisanal"" look.  But maybe it works to hold essential oil, too.
The fragrance lasts only for an hour or two, and that is as it should be, I think.  It does not interfere with the perfume I wear.  The lavender fragrance is mostly restricted to the bath.",B00W259T7G

Well, it smells great on my husband - a definite plus, for him! It doesn't seem to dry out his skin and since we have softened water, it is sometimes difficult to feel like you have rinsed all the soap off. This is good and doesn't seem to leave a residue.",B016V8YWBC
4983,"04 16, 2013",5.0,"This has a stronger scent than I would expect from a Dove product but it lessened once I used it with water and washed up. It feels nice and does a good job.

As mentioned the scent is strong but lessens when you use the soap. It is hard to describe the scent. It is not a perfume or cologne scent but more of a clean soap smell. I can smell it on my hands after using the soap and it smells fine.

The soap is slightly rounded and shaped so it is easy to hold and easy to use on my body. The color is not the clean white you get in some Dove soaps but a darker color that I would expect in a product that has ""purifying grains.""

This feels great on my skin and leaves a clean smell after use. I really like this.",B016V8YWBC
4984,"04 6, 2013",5.0,"Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn't leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black ""purifying grains"" in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation. This bar is ideal for both men and for women who don't like strongly-perfumed soaps.",B016V8YWBC
4985,"04 6, 2013",5.0,"Well, knock me over.  Here's a men's bar that I really like for myself.  First the scent is wonderful.  Fresh without being overly perfumey.

The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

So definitely would recommend.",B016V8YWBC
4986,"04 5, 2013",4.0,"I tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.",B016V8YWBC
4987,"03 28, 2013",4.0,"This is a great little soap. It is gentle enough to use on the face as it contains both moisturizing cream and mild exfoliants. As it is marketed to men,it has a strong woodsy/green aroma. I personally prefer the freshness one finds in most men's fragrances. I liked this one but  less is more. Although the scent dissipates somewhat, it is still quite noticeable. Therefore, I think it is better used as a body bar than a facial cleanser.

My experience with Dove products has been positive. They are good quality and reasonably priced. I think most men would be receptive to skin care but I think that subtle fragrance is more appealing than aggressive perfumes.",B016V8YWBC

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

I don't have particularly dry skin, so this is moisturizing enough for me, but if you're looking for a very rich lotion this might be too light for you.

Lavender fragrances vary and I have to say this is not one of my favorites  a bit too perfumey for my taste.

Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

5018,"09 16, 2017",5.0,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",B019FWRG3C

5024,"09 8, 2017",2.0,"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

5026,"09 7, 2017",3.0,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",B019FWRG3C
5027,"09 6, 2017",5.0,"Dried Lavender Blossoms? Amazing! If I had known that you could buy these, I would have purchased them a long time ago. We love the smell of lavender in our house. It is probably the top scent that we buy in all candles, waxes, etc. My original plan was to use this like potpourri. When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

Beautiful color!!!",B01E7UKR38
5077,"09 29, 2017",5.0,"Rock the runway is a bright red that reminds me of a fire engine red. It goes on like a cream polish, nothing iridescent or glittery. It's that classic red but slightly updated by being a little less muted. This one stands out.
And this is one of the absolute best top coats out there, at any price. The only way to get a better one, in my opinion, is if you use a UV gel, and who wants to spend nearly 20 minutes soaking in pure acetone in order to remove a UV gel?
I find that this polish and topcoat removes quickly with acetone, and less quickly with a non acetone polish remover.
The top coat also makes any little streaks or flaws in the polish disappear.",B01E7UKR38
5078,"09 26, 2017",5.0,"Rock the Runway is a simple, all purpose classic, pure bright but not overly-bright red. A Crayola red. A sharp choice for Christmas, Fourth of July, or even Valentine's Day. Creamy, opaque, quick drying and long wearing.  Just a great one.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.  This is one of several reds I own, and it's one of my favorites.",B01E7UKR38

It's the cheeriest of cherry reds, bright, bold and yet classic.
I get pretty long wear time, not 14 days but still longer than a traditional polish on my working fingers. And even then, it's usually because of tip wear or grow out, not because the polish has chipped.
For the price, this is my go to polish. Love it!!",B01E7UKR38

5082,"09 19, 2017",5.0,"Set aside about forty minutes and take your time with this. So, I waited for my favorite tv show to come on (so I wouldn't be tempted to walk around while waiting for my toes to dry) and began. In total, this is a three step process: apply a coat of color and wait, apply a second coat of color and wait, and finally apply the gel coat and wait. If you take your time, the end product is lovely! Nice color and super shiny!

Now, I know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. Avoid this. By following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. Trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. So, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. So, win-win!

This is a hearty polish! It does not chip easily and lasts over one week on fingernails and at least two on toenails! So, this is worth the price.

A fantastic combo! Recommended!",B01E7UKR38

5084,"08 15, 2017",3.0,"This set contains a nail polish and a topcoat, which are meant to give the appearance of a gel manicure.  They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!",B01E7UKR38
5085,"08 14, 2017",5.0,"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.  Love these!!!!",B01E7UKR38
5086,"07 29, 2017",5.0,"I don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish.

""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

I can usually get about 3 days before I start to see the first chip. I then touch it up with some polish and put a new topcoat on and that will get me another day, but after that it's chipping badly enough that I need to redo my nails.

5091,"07 23, 2017",5.0,"If I could give this duo six stars, I would. The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
Getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.

5177,"12 10, 2013",4.0,"This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....four brush attachments, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss.  But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing ""meter"".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.

He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.

The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

In all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.",B00CZH3K1C
5178,"05 15, 2013",5.0,"This is probably the ""smoothest"" tasting mouthwash I have ever used. It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. ""Smooth"" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.

To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.",B00DY59MB6

Both my husband and mother think the over 50 thing is a gimmick. Neither would buy it themselves.

It felt moisturizing when I put it on my hair in the shower, and not at all sticky (I had been afraid it would be sticky).  The smell is amazing- I'm pretty sure it's scented with essential oils.

5212,"05 28, 2015",5.0,"Best sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner ever! And...I've tried many. A little goes a long way, so don't hesitate to buy this wonderful product. .",B00MTR49IG
5213,"03 24, 2015",5.0,Very silky and smooth is the results I received after using the product.,B00MTR49IG
5214,"02 7, 2015",5.0,My hair feels really clean after using this shampoo & conditioner. I have hard water at home and I was using Neutrogena to remove the build-up and though it works well it also dried my hair out too much. This product does the same thing but leaves my hair feeling very clean & soft easy to manage. Very good product & would purchase again.,B00MTR49IG
5215,"05 21, 2015",4.0,"This conditioner is really nice. I like the fragrance it has. It is a nice, mild scent. This conditioner is thick and creamy My hair is dry, curly,and color-treated. This conditioner did a good job of conditioning my hair. I did not feel it was too heavy or weighed it down.",B00N2WQ2IW
5216,"05 20, 2015",5.0,"This would be a good conditioner to use every day as it rinses cleanly but leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.

The floral fragrance is very noticeable but fades.",B00N2WQ2IW

5218,"04 7, 2017",4.0,Have been using the product since I got my first as a gift and I like it.  I have dry coarse hair and it helps to soften it and take away the dullness.,B00QXW95Q4

5221,"01 15, 2017",5.0,My male roommate and I both love this shampoo! My hair looks healthy and never dry or frizzy when I use it consistently. All the Theorie products I have used have been excellent and do exactly what they promise. I would recommend it to anyone!,B00QXW95Q4

5224,"09 11, 2016",5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie.",B00QXW95Q4

5227,"06 1, 2017",4.0,nice,B00RZYW4RG
5228,"11 18, 2016",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,B00RZYW4RG
5229,"10 11, 2016",5.0,Best stuff ever!  Makes my hair less frizzy when using with a flat iron.  Makes it soft & silky.  Highly recommend!,B00RZYW4RG
5230,"09 2, 2016",3.0,"This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon anymore, you can only find it online. It is a great product if you are looking for a shine. It did not work well as an anti-frizz product.",B00RZYW4RG
5231,"07 25, 2016",4.0,"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone.",B00RZYW4RG

5242,"06 28, 2017",5.0,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!",B00VARTPKS
5243,"05 6, 2017",5.0,"This pressed powder goes on like silk, so light weight but covers well. I don't like to use a heavy powder that shows all the wrinkles, this one is just right!",B00VARTPKS
